I have an html game with an underwater theme. To this game I need an option menu with the options 'screenshake' and 'volume' which goes from 0 to 10. The whole game and settings can only be controlled with a spacebar so no mouse input. For differentiation, multiple press patterns are needed for checking which action is being executed. So I need one for controlling the setting, one for going through the multiple settings and applying all the settings for example.
